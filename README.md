# RhythmGame
Playing with rhythm game development. A few goals:

1. Learn Unity 2D
2. Make playable versions of several games suitable for practice scenarios:
    * Result tracking, run playback, live timing indicator, speed adjustment, etc. 
3. Maybe eventually make an actual game that combines several rhythm game mechanics
